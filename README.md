You will get notification about the result â€“ at this point you can decide if you want to see results or not.

```sh
HEADLESS=true node index.js
```

If you want to see results in chromium browser use standard mode.

```sh
node index.js
```

### Watcher

If you want to check for available dates periodically you can use Crontab for this.
For example to run LUX MED Watcher every 15 minutes follow those steps:


Open cron jobs list with `crontab -e` and add following job (each job should be placed in ots own line):
```
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/luxmed-watcher && HEADLESS=true REFERRAL_ID=999999999 /path/to/bin/node index.js
```
Make sure to replace `/path/to/luxmed-watcher` with a valid path to this repository and `/path/to/bin/node` with absolute path to `node` binary (you can check it with `which node`). To see your active cron jobs, use the `crontab -l` command.
